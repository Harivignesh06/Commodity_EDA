## Commodity Price Analysis (2000–2023)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the historical price movements of three major commodities — Gold, Copper, and Nickel — from the year 2000 to 2023.
The goal is to explore price trends, volatility, and correlations between these commodities in order to identify investment insights, risk levels, and diversification opportunities.

This analysis mimics a real-world data analyst/business analyst case study, making it useful both for learning and interview preparation.
