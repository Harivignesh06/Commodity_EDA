### **Commodity Price Analysis (2000–2023)**

##$ **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing the historical price movements of three major commodities — Gold, Copper, and Nickel — from the year 2000 to 2023.
The goal is to explore price trends, volatility, and correlations between these commodities in order to identify investment insights, risk levels, and diversification opportunities.

**Business Objective**

To analyze commodity price data over two decades and determine which commodity provides the safest investment option, while also identifying opportunities for diversification and timing strategies using statistical and financial metrics.

**Dataset Information**

**Shape:** 6,092 rows × 4 columns

**Columns:**

**Date** (daily records, not all calendar days available)

**Gold** (float – daily price)

**Copper** (float – daily price)

**Nickel** (float – daily price)

**Data Range:** 2000 – 2023

**Duplicates:** None

**Missing Values:** Present in some rows

**Findings & Insights**

**Gold:** Most stable commodity with lowest volatility, acts as a safe-haven asset.

**Copper:** Shows moderate risk, influenced by industrial demand and global economic cycles.

**Nickel:** Highly volatile with sharp daily swings, suitable for high-risk strategies.

**Diversification Benefit:** Low correlations (e.g., Gold–Nickel) suggest combining these commodities can reduce overall portfolio risk.

**Rolling Volatility:** Helps spot periods of heightened risk → useful for timing entry/exit decisions.
